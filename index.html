                    <p>Amy Jade Winehouse (14 September 1983 â€“ 23 July 2011) was an English singer and songwriter known for her deep, 
                    expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, rhythm and blues and jazz.</p>

                    <p>A member of the National Youth Jazz Orchestra during her youth, Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management 
                        in 2002 and soon recorded a number of songs before signing a publishing deal with EMI. She also formed a working 
                        relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, was released 
                        in 2003. Many of the album's songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, were co-written by Winehouse. 
                        Frank was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The song "Stronger Than Me" won her the 
                        Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.</p>

                    <p>Winehouse released her follow-up album, Back to Black, in 2006, which went on to become an international success and one 
                        of the best-selling albums in UK history.[1] At the 2007 Brit Awards it was nominated for British Album of the Year, and 
                        she received the award for British Female Solo Artist. The song "Rehab" won her a second Ivor Novello Award. At the 50th 
                        Grammy Awards in 2008, she won five awards, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night 
                        and becoming the first British woman to win five Grammys, including three of the General Field "Big Four" Grammy Awards: 
                        Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (for "Rehab"), as well as Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>

                    <p>Winehouse was plagued by drug and alcohol addiction. She died of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011, at the age of 27. 
                        After her death, Back to Black temporarily became the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century.[2] VH1 ranked Winehouse 
                        26th on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.</p>
